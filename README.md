# Kit Runs

Authors: Alla Hale

My husband, Kit Hale, enjoys running. So he runs. A lot.

This is a visualization of how far he has run since our second child was born.

This was originally an assignment for my Data Visualization class at UC Berkeley, and my first experience working with d3.js.

A few insights I took away from this project:

* Faster runs are definitely on the road, especially those with pace less than 8 min/mile.
* The very slow paced "runs" are very short, and happen later in the day. These are hikes with the little one.
* The ones with medium pace, 8-20 min/mile, are those trail runs. Hills are hard!
* He has four typical windows in which he runs.
	* Early morning
	* At lunch during work
	* Immediately after work
	* After the children are asleep. They won't always go to bed so early, will they?
* He almost never runs more than 10 miles past noon.
