        A Summary of the Recent Past <small>Kit Runs</small>
      </h1>
      <p>
        My husband, Kit Hale, enjoys running. So he runs. A lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is how far he has run since our second child was born.
      </p>

    <div class="container-fluid">

      <h3>Interesting!</h3>
      <p>
        Well, that's interesting. There are clearly two types of runs he does.
        He must mix up trail running and road running.
        Since I can't run even a mile, these all look very long to me.
        But it seems that he has long runs with lots of elevation gain--those must be on the trail.
        And then there are those impossibly long and flat runs--those must be on the road or treadmill.
        And what are those weirdo runs that take him over 30 minutes per mile? Maybe he's hiking with our adorable,
        but much slower preschooler?
      </p>
      <p>
        Hey, go back and touch or hover over the dots to see what time he's starting these runs.
        Who wakes up before 5 AM to start running at 6 AM. This guy.

        A few insights:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Faster runs are definitely on the road, especially those with pace less than 8 min/mile.</li>
        <li>The very slow paced "runs" are very short, and happen later in the day. These are hikes with the little one.</li>
        <li>The ones with medium pace, 8-20 min/mile, are those trail runs. Hills are hard!</li>
        <li>He has four typical windows in which he runs.</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Early morning</li>
            <li>At lunch during work</li>
            <li>Immediately after work</li>
            <li>After the children are asleep. They won't always go to bed so early, will they?</li>
          </ol>
        <li>He almost never runs more than 10 miles past noon.</li>
      </ul>
